 * 2) You pass a function as the children of this component. The function will get the
 * responsiveKey passed into it. Use this if you need to wrap a <div> or other DOM element that
 * can't extend its props with ResponsiveChildProps, or if you want to give the responsiveKey
 * to children below the top-level.
 *
 * Whichever flavour you opt for, you can conditionally hide or show anything inside it by
